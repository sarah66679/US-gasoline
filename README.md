## Background:

Gasoline prices experience volatility often credited to fluctuations in the crude oil market, but gasoline is subject to its own supply and demand pressures. Cyclical trends such as seasonal changes in refining costs, production adjustments, and changes in demand contribute to gasoline price movements over a typical year. Recently, however, market developments not influenced by seasonal fluctuations have affected prices. From 2010 to 2014, increased access to cost-advantaged domestic sources of crude oil has expanded domestic gasoline production, and evolving consumption patterns in the United States and abroad have altered both import and export demand.Strong growth in U.S. gasoline consumption has been one of the most important factors supporting oil prices in 2016, but some analysts question whether the official data is overstating the strength of gasoline demand.

U.S. gasoline consumption has been running at a record seasonal rate since February, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in its “Weekly Petroleum Status Report” (WPSR). but the consumption figures are so high that some analysts question whether the gasoline is being exported rather than consumed domestically. Because product supplied is calculated as a residual, any errors measuring production, imports, exports and stockpiles flow through directly into errors in implied consumption. The U.S. market is the biggest in supply and demand. The U.S. economy impact the global economy the most. Hence that gasoline consumption and gasoline price forecasts are very useful to industries, governments as well as individuals in the U.S. and the global.


## Data collection:  

We plan to take this problem by using publicly available data for gasoline, there rapidly changing dynamic of the market of gasoline prices and consumption like gasoline production, demand, supply, import, export and stocks. Data was collected from Energy Information Administration (EIA), Open source from government United States America DATA.GOV and King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC).



## Objectivity:

The purpose of this work is to identify gasoline consumption and factors that affect the price of gasoline and to obtain a reliable forecast model of gasoline consumption and gasoline prices. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to perform several tasks:
• Study the factors influencing the price of gasoline.
• Consider the method of forecasting using time-series.
• Collect and conduct descriptive data analysis.



## Time frame:

The project will take around 2 weeks of work, the Date Time will be in: 14 December 2019. 



## Challenges:
• Reliability of the data.
• External factors which affected overall result not covered by the study such as wither conditions or political issues.
